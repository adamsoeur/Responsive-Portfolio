      <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="profile">

      <p>Ever since I was a kid I have been enthralled by the wonder of computers and the internet. I had always been interested in understanding how exactly they work. When I graduated high school, I went to go work for my father's civil engineering firm. I put down my interest in computers and web sites to learn an entirely new subject to me that I wasn't quite sure I would enjoy. For 4 years I worked in that field, until one day I found it inside me to go back to my roots. Now I have the chance to learn what exactky makes the things I love tick.<br>In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, working out, and golf!</p>
